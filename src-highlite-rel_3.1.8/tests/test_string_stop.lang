comment delim "/*" "*/"

# thus this won't catch "/* */ /" as a regexp,
# since comment elem definition comes first
regexp = '/.*/.*/'

# this won't match if ( ) as a function,
# since keyword elem definition comes first
function = '([[:alpha:]]|_)[[:word:]]*[[:blank:]]*\(*[[:blank:]]*\)'

# the following order is conceptually wrong,
# since "//" won't be highlighted as a comment, but as two symbols
symbol = "/"
comment start "//"
