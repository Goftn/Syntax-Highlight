@c Generator: GNU source-highlight, by Lorenzo Bettini, http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite
@example
For instance, in this Texinfo manual, 
if I want to insert a @@@@ or a @@@{
I have to ``escape'' them to make them appear literally
since they have a special meaning in Texinfo.  
The same holds, e.g., 
for @@code@{<@}, @@code@{>@} or @@code@{&@} in HTML.  
If you use source-highlight,
it will take care of this, automatically for you.
